# Project Walkthrough

This is the build log for the inventory management app. It is updated at the end of each section of the project.

Each entry will capture:

- **What we built**: the concrete result of the section.
- **Why**: the reasoning behind it.
- **Important commands and decisions**: what was run, and what alternatives were considered.
- **Plain-language explanations**: short, non-jargon descriptions of the technologies involved, so a nontechnical reader can follow along.

See [milestones.md](milestones.md) for the list of sections and their progress and [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the design.

## Section 0: Foundation (in progress)

**Status:** Section 0, Foundation, is in progress; no application features are implemented.

**What we built.** Documentation and repository configuration files only: `README.md`, `SETUP.md`, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig`, and the three files in `docs/`. There is no application code yet.

**Why.** Writing down the purpose, planned stack, and rules before coding gives later work a clear target and keeps the project understandable to readers who are not developers.

**Decisions.**

- Transfers will preserve the original receipt date, so stock age stays accurate.
- Issuing stock will not use FIFO; users will select which batch to issue from.
- SQL Server's data will be kept in a named Docker volume.
- The app will run locally only; there will be no deployment and no integrations.

**Plain-language notes.**

- *`.gitignore`* tells Git which files to leave out of the project history, such as passwords, downloaded libraries, and build output.
- *`.editorconfig`* tells editors to use consistent formatting (indentation, line endings) so code looks the same no matter who edits it.

*This entry will be finalized when Section 0 is complete.*
